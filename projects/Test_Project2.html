    <h1>TLS 1.2 RSA Key Exchange Decryption</h1>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project demonstrates the use of multiple reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning tools to identify weaknesses in a webserver. The goal was to simulate how an attacker enumerates services, probes for misconfigurations, and discovers hidden content. This project also highlights how reconnaissance techniques can be detected server-side..</p>
    <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> The target system was an Nginx webserver I configured, hosting HTTPS with a self-signed TLS certificate.The webserver had a simple login page that logged inputs to a php file.</p>

    <p>The vulneravility scanning of the target webserver was carried out using Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, and Wireshark. The workflow began with service discovery to confirm exposed ports followed by TLS enumeration to determine which versions and cipher suites were supported. Next, Nikto was used to scan for misconfigurations and sensitive files, and Gobuster was employed to brute-force hidden directories. Finally, Wireshark was used to capture the scanning traffic in order to observe how such activity appears from the targets perspective<p>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> Firstly, Service discovery with Nmap confirmed that the target was hosting both HTTP and HTTPS. An initial scan identified Nginx running on ports 80 and 443.</p>

</figure>
    <p>TLS enumeration was then performed using Nmap’s ssl-enum-ciphers script. The initial results showed that the server was accepting connections over TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, both of which are deprecated and insecure. After reconfiguring Nginx to restrict connections to TLS 1.2 and higher, a second scan verified that the insecure protocols were disabled.</p>

    <p>Nikto was then launched against the HTTP service. The scan generated hundreds of automated GET requests in rapid succession, probing for common files and directories. Among the results was a PHP login page that had been placed deliberately on the server.<p>

      <p>To demonstrate that vulnerability scans can be actively detected by network admins, I ran TCPdump configured to the webservers IP from the attacker machine, I then ran the nikto scan again. I opened the .pcap in Wireshark to see the flood of requests Nikto causes during its scanning<p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The assessment confirmed two exposed services, HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443. TLS scanning initially revealed the presence of legacy protocols, which were removed through reconfiguration. Nikto flagged several misconfigurations and discovered an exposed login form, while Gobuster successfully enumerated additional directories. Wireshark captured the Nikto traffic, highlighting how visible automated scanning appears on the network..</p>
    <p><strong>Value:</strong> This project demonstrates the ability to perform vulnerability scanning using a range of tools and to interpret their findings in context. It shows competence in configuring a server, identifying insecure defaults, and applying remediation measures such as restricting TLS versions. It also highlights the importance of validating scanner output and understanding how scanning traffic is observable from a defensive perspective.</p>
