    <h1>Inside attacker Privilage-Escalation</h1>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> In this project I demonstrate how a single misconfigured SUID  binary can allow escalation from a restricted user account to full root compromise. My aim was to simulate a realistic penetration-testing scenario where careful enumeration of privilege boundaries exposed an anomalous binary, and to show how that weakness could be exploited and then remediated.</p>
    <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> I started by configuring a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine where I created a non-privileged user account to act as the attacker’s foothold. To simulate a misconfiguration commonly seen in practice, I introduced a root-owned binary into <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and applied the SUID bit. I began by confirming that my attacker account had no elevated privileges. I then enumerated the system to locate binaries with the SUID permission set. I then identified the unusual entry, inspected its properties, and executed it to test whether it could be abused. After confirming escalation, I validated the impact by reading a file normally restricted to root, and finally remediated the misconfiguration by removing the SUID bit and proving the escalation path no longer worked.</p>
   <h3><strong>Process:</strong></h3>
<p>I began as the restricted <code>attacker</code> user. Running <code>whoami</code> and <code>id</code> confirmed I had no administrative privileges, and attempts to read <code>/etc/shadow</code> failed with “Permission denied.”</p>

<p>Next, I enumerated SUID binaries using <code>find / -perm -4000 -type f</code>. Alongside the standard system entries, an unusual binary named <code>suid_adm</code> appeared in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>

  <figcaption>Enumeration revealed an anomalous SUID binary: <code>/usr/local/bin/suid_adm</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Inspection with <code>ls -l</code> showed the binary was owned by root and marked with the SUID bit (<code>-rwsr-xr-x</code>), making it a candidate for privilege escalation.</p>

<p>Executing <code>suid_adm</code> dropped me into a new shell. Repeating <code>whoami</code> and <code>id</code> confirmed my user context had changed to root.</p>

<p>With elevated privileges, I was able to access <code>/etc/shadow</code>, validating the severity of the misconfiguration.</p>

  <figcaption>Root access enabled reading of <code>/etc/shadow</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, I remediated the issue by removing the SUID bit with <code>chmod u-s</code>. Verifying with <code>ls -l</code> showed normal permissions (<code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>), and re-executing the binary as the restricted user no longer provided elevated privileges.</p>

<h3><strong>Result:</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Through this workflow I escalated privileges from an unprivileged account to root by exploiting a single misconfigured binary. I then demonstrated that removing the SUID bit immediately closed the escalation path.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Value:</strong></h3>
  <p>
    This project highlights how attackers approach privilege escalation in practice. From my perspective as the attacker, the key steps were enumeration, anomaly detection, exploitation and validation. From the defender’s perspective, the project reinforces the importance of regularly auditing binaries with elevated permissions and removing unnecessary SUID bits. Including this case study in my portfolio demonstrates not only that I can identify and exploit misconfigurations, but also that I understand how to remediate them. It complements my other work on TLS and vulnerability scanning by adding a system-level exploitation example, reflecting scenarios that regularly appear in real penetration tests.
