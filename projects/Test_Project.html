   <h1>TLS 1.2 RSA Key Exchange Decryption</h1>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This project explored the use of JA3 fingerprinting to detect man-in-the-middle attacks. My goal was to demonstrate that I could build and analyse an intercepted TLS environment, and use fingerprinting techniques to distinguish malicious traffic from normal sessions.</p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>I configured three virtual machines: a client, an attacker using Mitmproxy, and a webserver. This setup gave me control over both ends of the traffic flow and the ability to introduce and observe an active interception. I enabled the JA3 plugin in Wireshark to capture and hash TLS ClientHello messages.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>I first captured baseline traffic from the client’s browser connecting directly to the server. I then placed the attacker in the middle using Mitmproxy, repeated the connection, and captured that traffic. Both captures were analysed individually in Wireshark, where I noted the JA3 fingerprints for comparison.</p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p> The JA3 hash from the clean browser session was different from the hash produced when Mitmproxy intercepted the traffic. This confirmed that the handshake characteristics change in a detectable way when a MITM proxy is present. However, when searching for a hash match of the MITM proxy hash in JA3 hash databases, no matches were found, showing the need for hash databases to be continually updated. </p>
   
    <h3>Value</h3>
    <p>Demonstrates I can setup and configure a secure lab, capture analyse and decrypt traffic, and exploit weaknesses of TLS 1.2 when configured with RSA ciphers. </p>
