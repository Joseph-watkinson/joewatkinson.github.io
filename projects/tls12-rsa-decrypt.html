    <h1>TLS 1.2 RSA Key Exchange Decryption</h1>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      Demonstrate how TLS&nbsp;1.2 sessions configured with RSA key exchange are
      vulnerable if a server’s private key is compromised. Because RSA does not
      provide forward secrecy, previously recorded traffic can be decrypted
      after the fact.
    </p>

    <h3>Environment & Threat Model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Three VMs: <strong>client</strong>, <strong>attacker</strong>, <strong>nginx webserver</strong> (self-signed certificate).</li>
      <li>Webserver restricted to TLS&nbsp;1.2 RSA cipher suites only.</li>
      <li>Client submitted login credentials over HTTPS.</li>
      <li>Attacker captured traffic with <code>tcpdump</code>.</li>
      <li>Threat model assumption: attacker has access to the server’s private key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Methodology & Process</h3>
    <p>
      Three VMs were configured: a client, an attacker, and an nginx webserver
      with a self-signed certificate. The server was restricted to RSA cipher
      suites under TLS 1.2. The client logged into a simple HTTPS form hosted by
      the webserver, while the attacker monitored traffic with tcpdump.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traffic was captured with tcpdump and saved as a <code>.pcap</code>. In
      Wireshark, HTTP filters confirmed TLS 1.2 with RSA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The webserver’s private key was then imported into Wireshark and applied
      to the encrypted POST packet.

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
      Importing the server’s private key into Wireshark enabled decryption of
      the POST packet. Subsequently, the HTTP POST request, including plaintext
      username and password, was successfully recovered.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> RSA key exchange allows an attacker with the private key to retroactively decrypt all previously recorded sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> This scenario is relevant only where RSA cipher suites are enabled. Most modern servers use ECDHE/DHE with forward secrecy.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning outcome:</strong> Configuring a lab, capturing and analyzing encrypted traffic, and applying cryptographic knowledge in practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Defensive Relevance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable RSA-based cipher suites and enforce forward-secret ciphers such as ECDHE.</li>
      <li>Audit TLS configurations to ensure strong ciphers are enforced.</li>
      <li>Recognize that if a private key leaks, all previously captured traffic is compromised.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ethical Context</h3>
    <p>
      This exercise was conducted entirely in a self-controlled lab environment
      for educational purposes. No external systems were targeted.
